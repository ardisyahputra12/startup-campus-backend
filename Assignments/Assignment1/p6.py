Factorial. [WEIGHT = 1]

Given an integer n (n <= 20), find the factorial of n (usually formulated as n!).

Factorial of n can be described as the multiplication of n with all positive integers
less than n. In other words, n! = n * (n-1) * ... * 1
 
If n is less than 0, return -1 and if n = 0, return 1.
