# Objective

To test your understanding of basic Python syntax and ability to arrange logic sequence within Python functions.

# Instructions

## Setup

Before anything else, check if there's any new updates by [syncing new updates to your private repository](https://gitlab.com/startupcampus.be/startup-campus-backend#sync-repository). Do this everytime you are notified that there are new updates.

Then create a new Merge Request for this assigment by following these steps:
- Go to your repo homepage (`https://gitlab.com/<your_gitlab_username>/startup-campus-backend`)
- From the left sidepanel, go to `Repository > Branches`
- Click `New Branch` button on the top right
- Input `assignment-1` on the Branch name, make sure you are creating from `main` branch and then click `Create branch`
- Wait until redirected to a new page with a notification that you just pushed to your new branch, click `Create merge request`
- In the `New merge request` page
  - Check **Squash commits ...** option on the bottom
  - Feel free to leave everything else as is
  - Click `Create Merge Request`

and you should be done! 

You can now start working on your local machine by clicking  `Code > Check out branch` from the new Merge Request page.

## Definition

In this assignment, you will try to complete implementations of Python functions. In this folder, there will be multiple Python files and you will implement **1 function per file**. In each file you will see
- detailed description of what a function should do, including
  - what arguments the function accept
  - what the output should be
  - test cases
- empty function definition


Simply remove the `pass` statement within the function context and start coding
```py
def function_to_implement(...)
    # your code here
    ...
```

If you encounter any issues understanding the problem statement, feel free to ask and reach out to your mentors!

## Testing

## Submission

Push your changes to the branch (created via Merge Request) and simply **copy paste the Merge Request URL** into the corresponding **Assignment folder** in your **Google Classroom** account.
