### Mirror repository

### Clone repository

In your local machine, go to a folder then run this command
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/startupcampus.be/startup-campus-backend.git
```
then authenticate with your Gitlab credentials.

### Virtual environment

After installing Python, you want to enable virtual environment to isolate each working environment as you might use different set of Python packages with different versions in each environment. 

To install, run the following
```
python3.9 -m pip install virtualenv

```
then choose a name for your environment. For instance, if the name is `startup-campus` then run the following
```
python3.9 -m venv startup-campus
```
